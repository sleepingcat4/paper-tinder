I created **paper tinder**, because I am sometimes fed-up on how many papers are constantly uploaded everyday on different categories and how much of them I read. To mitigate these off-shoots, I have created a tinder match that's light-weight and fast for reading hogs like us.

How paper tinder works?

Paper tinder, asks the user to input links of the user's fav arXiv papers and then ask how many arXiv paper be used aganist their fav papers to build a weighted **trie** structure. further, it shows the user 20 choices and the user can reinforce their liking through 

1. Like
2. Reject

and receuve 10 matches based on Jenson-Shanon similarity metric. 

Note: It is an constantly updated repo with new features and re-org set to hit heavily in the next couple of days.
